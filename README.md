# Introduction
This GitHub Repository is the home of the coding components of the Nuclear Engineering course at UNB, which is discussed in the following paper:
  O. Y. Palazhchenko, B.A. Loder, J.D.F. Miles, and A. Martin, "Programming in a Revived Program Option: Training the "Nuclear Programmer".

In this repository, you will find the following folders:
  - Setup: This folder contains the Python and Eclipse start-up information provided to students. This course used Github as a means of sending the coding section of the assignments to the teaching assistant for marking.
  - Coding Excerises: Included in this folder is information on each coding exercise given in this course. This includes the background readings, which was relevant Python information that would be needed for the corresponding coding exercise, and the coding exercise itself.
  - Assignments: Each assignment contained a coding component, worth 25% of the assignment. Only the coding question from each assignment is presented here.
