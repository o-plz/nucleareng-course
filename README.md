# Introduction
This GitHub Repository is the home of the coding components of the Nuclear Engineering course at UNB, which is discussed in the following paper:
  O. Y. Palazhchenko, B.A. Loder, J.D.F. Miles, and A. Martin, "Programming in a Revived Program Option: Training the "Nuclear Programmer".

In this repository, you will find the following folders:
  - Setup
  - Coding Excerises
  - Assignments

## Setup
This section contains a file that was provided to the students on how to get Python and Eclipse working. Eclipse was the IDE chosen for this course, but there are many other IDE's that could be chosen.
A GitHub Repository was also used for the students to commit finished assignments for marking.

## Coding Exercises
Within this folder, there are additional folders that hold the associated excerise and background reading. Background readings contain information about relevant Python coding information that corresponds to the related coding excercise. There is an associated .py file with each background reading to demonstrate the coding used. The solutions to the coding exercise is also provided.

## Assignments
Each assignment featured a coding component, worth 25% of the assignment. The coding question from each assignment is provided, as well as the solutions PDF and the .py solutions file.
